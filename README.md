# Reference Implementations and Tests

This repository is to share reusable components and testing of our framework with Open Source contributors. 

## Charting and Data Visualization

We have to make some decisions on Data Vis and it seems as always there are tons of great options. 

We will evaluate the following

1. AirBNB visx: [https://airbnb.io/visx/gallery](https://airbnb.io/visx/gallery)
2. Nivo: [https://nivo.rocks/radar/](https://nivo.rocks/radar/)
3. Recharts: [https://recharts.org/en-US/examples](https://recharts.org/en-US/examples)
4. Victory: [https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-chart/)

## Window Management and Dashboard Layouts that are configurable are important as well

1. Mosaic Window Manager: [https://nomcopter.github.io/react-mosaic/](https://nomcopter.github.io/react-mosaic/)
2. Tile Pane: [https://github.com/xcfox/react-tile-pane](https://github.com/xcfox/react-tile-pane)
3. Flex Layout: [https://github.com/caplin/FlexLayout](https://github.com/caplin/FlexLayout)
